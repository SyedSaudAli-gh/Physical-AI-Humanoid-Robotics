# Introduction to Gazebo & Unity

Gazebo and Unity serve as the digital twin environment for humanoid robots, enabling simulation-based development, testing, and validation of robotic behaviors without requiring physical hardware. This module covers how to create realistic simulation environments for humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up simulation environments in Gazebo for robotic testing
- Integrate Unity for advanced visualization and physics simulation
- Model humanoid robots in simulation environments
- Validate robot behaviors through simulated scenarios

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of 3D visualization concepts
- Basic familiarity with physics simulation
- Knowledge of basic robotics concepts from Module 1
