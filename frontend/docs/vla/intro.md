# Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems enable conversational robotics by connecting visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action. This module covers how to build intelligent humanoid robots that can understand and respond to human commands.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Integrate vision and language models for robotic interaction
- Implement action planning based on visual and linguistic input
- Create conversational interfaces for humanoid robots
- Develop multimodal AI systems for robotic applications

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of natural language processing
- Knowledge of computer vision from Module 3
- Familiarity with action planning concepts
