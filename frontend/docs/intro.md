# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook - a comprehensive guide to bridging digital minds to physical bodies. This textbook covers the essential technologies and concepts needed to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots through four core modules.

## Security Notice

For developers contributing to this project, please review our [Security Best Practices](./security/environment-variables.md) documentation to understand how to properly handle API keys and environment variables. Security is paramount when dealing with AI systems and robotics applications.

## Overview

This textbook is structured around four core modules:

1. **ROS 2** - The Robotic Nervous System
2. **Gazebo & Unity** - The Digital Twin
3. **NVIDIA Isaac** - AI-Driven Perception
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Conversational Robotics

Each module contains detailed chapters covering theoretical foundations, practical simulations, code examples, and capstone projects.

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Undergraduate and graduate students in AI, computer science, and robotics engineering
- Educators seeking to integrate embodied intelligence into curricula
- Practitioners interested in humanoid robotics development

## How to Use This Textbook

You can navigate through the textbook using the sidebar on the left. Each module contains 3-4 chapters with increasing complexity. The content is designed to be adaptable based on your technical background through our personalization features.

For interactive learning, we've included a RAG chatbot that can answer questions about the content and help clarify complex concepts.
