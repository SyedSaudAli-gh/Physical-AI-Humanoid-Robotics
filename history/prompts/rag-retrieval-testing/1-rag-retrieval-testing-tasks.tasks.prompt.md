   - Initialize API clients
   - Define data models

3. **Phase 3: User Story 1 (P1)** - 6 tasks
   - Core retrieval functions implementation
   - Query processing flow
   - Performance validation

4. **Phase 4: User Story 2 (P2)** - 7 tasks
   - Unit tests for retrieval functions
   - Integration tests for pipeline
   - End-to-end validation

5. **Phase 5: User Story 3 (P3)** - 6 tasks
